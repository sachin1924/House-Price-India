# 🏡 House Price India - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **House Price India** dataset. The aim is to identify and understand the key factors influencing house prices across different regions in India using Python-based data analysis tools.

## 📊 Project Overview

The project leverages a real-world dataset to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns in housing prices. The analysis provides insights that can support real estate professionals, data enthusiasts, and buyers/sellers in making informed, data-driven decisions.

## 🔍 Dataset Source

- **Title**: House Price India
- **Source**: Publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Format**: CSV
- **Features Include**:
  - House Area
  - Bedrooms
  - Basement Area
  - Renovation Year
  - Location Coordinates
  - Nearby Hospitals and Schools
  - Price (Target)

## ⚙️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔬 EDA Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicates
   - Renamed columns
   - Handled missing values
   - Dropped irrelevant features

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Added binary column for renovated status

3. **Visual Analysis**:
   - Heatmap for correlation
   - Pair plots for top influencing features
   - Pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots for deeper insight

4. **Spatial Analysis**:
   - Longitude and Latitude vs Price scatter plots

5. **Amenity Impact**:
   - Relationship between number of schools/hospitals and house prices

## 🎯 Key Insights

- **House area** and **basement area** are highly correlated with price.
- **Renovated houses** tend to have slightly higher prices.
- **Location** plays a significant role in price variation.
- Proximity to **schools and hospitals** shows mild influence on price.

## 📈 Future Scope

- Implement ML models to predict house prices.
- Integrate external data like crime rate, public transport, etc.
- Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI/Tableau.
- Use geospatial analysis for advanced location-based insights.
- Segment houses into price brackets for market analysis.
